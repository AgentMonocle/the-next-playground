Using beads let's make modifications to the development plan.
1) The Sharepoint Site will be the existing sales organization site (https://tejasre.sharepoint.com/sites/sales"
2) Please review the data files in reference/datasets which are exports of lists (csv with schema) that I developed earlier that I would like to incorporate (the information, not that actual lists) into the development plan. Provide a report on how you will incorporate this information.
	1) Client Records.csv
	2) Company Records.csv
	3) Countries.csv
		1) Companies have relationships to other companies.  One Example is China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) is the parent company of China National Petroleum Corporate - USA (CNPCUS).  Understanding this hierarchy allows us to see all opportunities for a company and all its subsidiary entities.
3) Using TSS again inside the TSS_Opportunity_Documents please research 7 different ID Generation Strategies and let me review them to select one.
	1) Oportunity IDs are an internal facing ID and should be easily decoded to differentiate easily for internal personal.
	2) Quotation IDs will be both internal and external facing so that should be easily decodable to the client as to provide insights (like how many IDs we generate in a year).
