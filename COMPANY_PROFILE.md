## CRM Implications

This company profile directly informs how the Sales CRM should be designed:

### What the CRM Must Track

| CRM Entity | Maps To | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Companies** | E&P Operators, Service Companies, Engineering/Testing Clients | Core customer accounts |
| **Contacts** | Completions engineers, production engineers, procurement managers, operations managers | Decision makers and influencers at each account |
| **Opportunities** | Product quotes, engineering projects, testing campaigns, new well completion packages | Revenue pipeline |
| **Activities** | Emails, meetings, calls, site visits, training sessions, trade shows | Sales touchpoints and relationship history |
| **Products** | FlowGARD, InjectGARD, FlowGATE, etc. (full product catalog) | Line items on opportunities, product-level analytics |
| **Documents** | Proposals, datasheets, test reports, engineering deliverables, POs | Attached to opportunities and accounts |

### Key CRM Workflows

1. **Opportunity Pipeline**: Track quotes from initial inquiry → technical review → proposal → negotiation → order → delivery. Stages should reflect Tejas's actual sales process
2. **Well/Project Tracking**: Opportunities are often tied to specific wells or field projects — the CRM should capture well name, field, basin, and operator
3. **Product Configuration**: Opportunities may involve multiple products (e.g., FlowGARD + HIFLO Lock + FlexLOK as a system sale). Need line-item level tracking
4. **Email Integration**: Sales team communicates heavily via Outlook email with customers. Auto-linking emails to contacts and opportunities is critical
5. **Activity History**: Complete record of interactions per contact and per account — for relationship continuity when sales reps change
6. **Engineering Project Tracking**: Longer-cycle engagements with milestones (feasibility → design → prototype → testing → delivery)
7. **Testing Campaign Tracking**: Testing services have their own lifecycle (scope → schedule → execute → report)
8. **Green Energy Pipeline**: CCS and geothermal opportunities may have different stages and longer cycles than traditional oil & gas
9. **International vs Domestic**: Flag opportunities by geography; international sales may have different requirements (export compliance, logistics)
10. **Competitive Intelligence**: Track which competitors are bidding on the same opportunities

### Opportunity Stages (Suggested)

| Stage | Description |
|---|---|
| **Lead** | Initial inquiry or identified prospect |
| **Qualification** | Confirmed need, budget, timeline, decision-maker identified |
| **Technical Review** | Engineering team evaluating product fit, well conditions, specifications |
| **Proposal** | Quote/proposal submitted to customer |
| **Negotiation** | Commercial terms being finalized |
| **Won** | Order received |
| **Lost** | Opportunity closed without order |
| **Delivered** | Product shipped / service completed |

### Dashboard KPIs (Suggested)

| KPI | Description |
|---|---|
| Pipeline by Stage | Total value at each opportunity stage |
| Pipeline by Product Line | Revenue split: Well Intervention vs New Completions vs Green Energy vs Services |
| Win Rate | Won / (Won + Lost) by time period |
| Revenue by Account | Top customers by revenue |
| Revenue by Geography | Domestic vs International; by basin/region |
| Activity Volume | Emails, meetings, calls per sales rep per week |
| Average Sales Cycle | Days from Lead to Won by product category |
| Forecast | Weighted pipeline (Amount × Probability) |
