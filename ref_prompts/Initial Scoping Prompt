Use beads to create a development plan please incorporate these additional details

# The development plan should:
1) Define the system name as Tejas Sales System and use the abbreviation of TSS.
2) Log users into the system via Microsoft Azure framework (thier Microsoft 365 login) for interacting with the system and the ecosystem it integrate with.
3) Consider functionality based on Microsoft 365 + JotForm Enterprise

# I would like the development plan to include
1) documentation for the naming standards for objects (primarily lists) that will be loaded into the Sharepoint
2) documentation for the objects (primarily lists) that will be loaded into the Sharepoint
3) documentation for the schema/relationship of the objects loaded into the Sharepoint.
4) cover strategies for tracting activities, such as customer interactions, while minimizing the need to manual data entry.
5) a dedicated section for the setup and configuration of dependencies like MS Graph Permissions, Azure setup, etc. with clear references for why each dependencies is needed (what functions they support0
6) a strategy for staged development and deployment of features, we want to start with a basic proof of concept functionality and add features from there (after we have a working beta).
7) a strategy for debugging, monitoring, alerting if we need it.
